# Quaker HD for HP webOS TouchPad

Quaker HD was created in 2010 as a pre-launch app for HP's webOS TouchPad Tablet.  

Quaker HD brings breaking news of earthquakes from around the world to your HP webOS TouchPad.  Based on the highly rated Quaker app for webOS phones, Quaker HD takes full advantage of the tablet to provide unparalleled reporting on earthquakes from around the world using real-time data from the USGS. 
Using a global map, you can quickly see all of the earthquakes (above magnitude 2.5) which have happened within the last seven days.  

By tapping on the map, you can zoom in to see the details of each quake, and quickly share this information with friends and family using Facebook, Twitter, email, and messaging (SMS or IM).  Quaker HD receives up-to-date earthquake information directly from the USGS data feed, providing a wealth of data and insight into earthquake patterns, including USGS charts such as “Did You Feel  It?”,  “Seismic Hazard Maps”, “Theoretical P-Wave Travel Times”, “Earthquake Density”, “Historic Seismicity”, and “Historic Moment Tensor Solutions”. With a single tap you can view the USGS website for each quake, which allows you to dig deep into the details and the impact of the quake. 

This initial version of Quaker HD provides notifications of new quakes while the application is running, and will be updated with background notifications, filtering (based on magnitude, location, and time). Be the first to know when a major quake occurs, and learn about the amazing and powerful forces which affect us all.
